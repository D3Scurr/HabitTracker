A simple Habit Tracker and overall self improvement site for my first real project
Simple habit list with adding habits
Timer that I can start and stop

To Do:
 - Random quote for the day (for now for the refresh of the site)
 - Streak system, consistent days, numbers of focus blocks done
 - Reminder when to sleep (REM phase tracker)
 - XP, leveling system
 - Back End
 - Slack off section
 - "I'm feeling tired" button
To Expand:
 - Checking the habits off
 - Customizable timer (how much of focus and break time)
 - Saving favorite quotes
 - Do an actual design and styling
